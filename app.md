## Rendering performance 101
*Rendering performance is all about how fast you can draw your activity, and get it updated on the screen. Success here means your users feeling like your application is smooth and responsive, which means that you’ve got to get all your logic completed, _and_ all your rendering done in 16ms or less, each and every frame. But that might be a bit more difficult than you think. In this video, +Colt McAnlis takes a look at what “rendering performance” means to developers, alongside some of the most common pitfalls that are ran into; and let’s not forget the important stuff: the tools that help you track down, and fix these issues before they become large problems.*

## Why 60fps

*When trying to build the most performant application possible, it’s important to know why so much effort and attention is built into the hardware, system, and APIs to target the “60fps” target. In this video +Colt McAnlis walks you through how the human visual system works, and why 60 frames a second is the perfect target to shoot for to keep your users happy, and worry free.*
